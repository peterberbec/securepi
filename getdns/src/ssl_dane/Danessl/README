Danessl version 0.01
====================

The Danessl module implements functions for validating TLSA record
syntax and using valid TLSA records to verify SSL certificate chains.
It can be used at the completion of an SSL handshake to validate
the peer's certificate chain, or to validate off-line chains not
associated with any current SSL connection.

Performing any requisite DNSSEC validated TLSA record lookups
and Making SSL connections to determine a particular peer's
certificate chain is left to the application.  The Net::DNS
and Net::SSLeay modules can be used for those tasks.
