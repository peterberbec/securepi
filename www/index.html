	<h1>Secure Pi</h1>
	<p>In the following pages, you will setup your SecurePi to provide safe, encrypted, ad-free
	internet access to your computer. There are a few steps, but we will guide you along the way.</p>
	<p>Note: Your browser may notify you the information you are entering may be stolen because the
	connection is insecure. This is technically true, but since this connection is only going over
	the USB cable between your computer and the SecurePi, you will be safe. Just make sure no one
	sneaks up on you and hacks into that USB cable! :)</p>
